Overview of the MNIST Digit Classification Algorithm
This project implements a neural network using the MNIST dataset, a popular dataset for handwritten digit classification. The aim is to classify grayscale images of digits (0-9) into their respective classes using a basic artificial neural network (ANN).

1. Dataset Overview
The MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits, divided into 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. Each image is a 28x28 pixel grayscale image, where each pixel has a value between 0 and 255 representing the intensity of the pixel. The task is to classify each image into one of the 10 digit classes (0-9).

2. Data Preprocessing
Before feeding the data into the neural network, the pixel values are normalized by dividing them by 255. This ensures that the input values range between 0 and 1, which helps in improving the convergence of the neural network during training. Additionally, the images are flattened from their original 2D shape (28x28) into 1D arrays (of 784 elements), making them compatible with the neural network input layer.

3. Model Architecture
The artificial neural network (ANN) used here is a fully connected feedforward network, which consists of the following layers:

Input Layer: The input layer accepts the flattened 784-pixel array as input.
Hidden Layer: A dense hidden layer with 100 neurons and ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function is used. The ReLU function introduces non-linearity into the network, enabling it to learn more complex patterns from the data.
Output Layer: The output layer consists of 10 neurons, each representing one of the digit classes (0-9). The softmax activation function is applied in this layer to output a probability distribution over the 10 classes.
4. Model Compilation
The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer, which is an adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm, ensuring efficient training. The Sparse Categorical Crossentropy loss function is employed, which is suitable for multi-class classification tasks where the class labels are integers. The model also tracks accuracy as a performance metric during training and evaluation.

5. Training the Model
The neural network is trained on the normalized training dataset for a specified number of epochs (in this case, 10 epochs). During each epoch, the network adjusts its weights using the backpropagation algorithm to minimize the loss function and improve accuracy.

6. Model Evaluation
After training, the model is evaluated on the test set to determine its accuracy on unseen data. This evaluation provides an indication of how well the model generalizes beyond the training data.

7. Making Predictions
Once the model is trained, predictions are made on the test set. The model outputs a probability distribution over the 10 classes for each test image, and the class with the highest probability is selected as the predicted label.

8. Confusion Matrix
A confusion matrix is computed to provide a more detailed assessment of the model's performance. The confusion matrix shows how many times the model predicted each class correctly or incorrectly by comparing the true labels against the predicted labels. It provides insights into which classes the model struggles with.

9. Classification Report
A classification report is generated, summarizing the model's precision, recall, and F1-score for each digit class. These metrics provide additional evaluation details by showing how well the model performs on individual classes, balancing between false positives and false negatives.

10. Visualization
Finally, a heatmap of the confusion matrix is visualized using Seaborn, making it easier to interpret the results and identify any patterns in the model's misclassifications.

This implementation demonstrates the workflow of building and evaluating a basic neural network for digit classification, providing an introduction to supervised learning and neural networks using the MNIST dataset.
